## How to play

**Getting Started**

1. one user can either play the game online by clicking [here](https://kind-kepler-f81b3d.netlify.app)
  **OR**
   Clone from the git [here](https://github.com/mahmoud717/JS-Game/tree/game), the process of cloning are listed below in the getting started part.

**Scene-main:**

1. User can see a character/avatar on the screen at this point, which already has started running on the platform.
2. The avatar/character will die if it falls from the platform or catches fire.
3. These situations can be avoided with 1 or 2 jumps.
4. In the path the avatar/character can earn a point/score by catching the stars appearing on the path.
5. To get a score the avatar/character has to jump again sometimes.
6. The avatar/character can jump(one mouse-click)/ doublejump(double mouse-click).
7. If the avatar/character died from the fire or by falling from the platform, then the Scene Game_Over will appear.

**Scene-game-over:**

1. Here User can see an input filed, a submit-score button, a restart button, and a Leaderboard button.
2. **The input filed**: here the user can enter the name.
3. **The submit-score button**: by clicking the send score button the sore will be sent to a leader board.
4. **The restart button**: by clicking it the user can restart the game again.
5. **Leaderboard button**: clicking here will invoke the scene leader-board.

**Scene-leader-board:**
